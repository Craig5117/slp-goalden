<strong>Description</strong>


This application allows a speech therapist to assess the level of progress his/her students or subjects are making towards a set goal(s).A therapist can set a goal(s) for each student by generating a series of YES and No questions. The trials for each student is recorded and  the answers given by each student are calculated as a percentage of the number of questions answered correctly. This app allows the user to be able to apply the acronym CRUD, which stands for create, read, update, and delete. Although, presently the delete function doen't work, but we intend to incorpiorate it into the app in the future.
